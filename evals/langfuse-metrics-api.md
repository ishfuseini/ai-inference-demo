# Metrics API

```
GET /api/public/v2/metrics
```

The **Metrics API** enables you to retrieve customized analytics from your Langfuse data.
This endpoint allows you to specify dimensions, metrics, filters, and time granularity to build powerful custom reports and dashboards for your LLM applications.

## What you can do

Use the Metrics API to:

- Aggregate cost, token usage, volume, latency, and score data.
- Group results by supported dimensions, such as model or trace attributes.
- Filter data and analyze trends over time.
- Power custom reports, dashboards, billing, and monitoring workflows.

For supported views, fields, query parameters, response schemas, and interactive examples, see the [v2 Metrics API Reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com/#tag/metricsv2/GET/api/public/v2/metrics). For practical Python examples, see the [Metrics API v2 cookbook](/guides/cookbook/example_metrics_api_v2).

The deprecated `GET /api/public/metrics` and `GET /api/public/metrics/daily` endpoints are documented, with migration steps, in [Migration of deprecated APIs](/faq/all/deprecated-api-migration).

## Metrics API v2 [#v2]

**Data availability:** Data from older SDKs (`langfuse-python` < `4.7.0`, `langfuse-js` < `5.4.0`) or direct OpenTelemetry exporters that do not send `x-langfuse-ingestion-version: 4` can be delayed by up to 15 minutes on v2 endpoints. Upgrade to [Python SDK v4.7.0+](/docs/observability/sdk/upgrade-path/python-v3-to-v4) or [JS/TS SDK v5.4.0+](/docs/observability/sdk/upgrade-path/js-v4-to-v5), or [set that header on your OTEL span exporter](/integrations/native/opentelemetry#real-time-ingestion) to see new data in real time. Details: [Versions & Compatibility](/docs/compatibility#faq-delay).

On self-hosted Langfuse v3, use the [Metrics API v1](/faq/all/deprecated-api-migration#metrics-v1) instead; see the [self-hosted compatibility matrix](/self-hosting/upgrade/versioning#sdk-server).

```
GET /api/public/v2/metrics
```

The v2 Metrics API provides significant performance improvements through an optimized data architecture built on the wide observations table, which minimizes database work per query.

### Key Changes from v1

**The `traces` view is no longer available in v2.** Instead, use the `observations` view which is both faster and more powerful compared to v1.

### Available Views in v2

| View                 | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `observations`       | Query observation-level data with optional trace-level aggregations                           |
| `scores-numeric`     | Query numeric scores                                                                          |
| `scores-categorical` | Query categorical (string) scores                                                             |
| `scores-boolean`     | Query boolean scores; group or filter by `booleanValue`, or average `value` for the true rate |

### Row Limit

The v2 Metrics API enforces a default `config.row_limit` of 100 rows per query to ensure consistent performance. You can specify a custom `config.row_limit` in your query to override this default, up to a maximum of 1,000 rows.

### High Cardinality Dimensions

Certain dimensions like `id`, `traceId`, `userId`, and `sessionId` cannot be used for grouping in the v2 Metrics API. Grouping by these high cardinality fields is extremely expensive and rarely useful in practice. These dimensions remain available for filtering.

### Semantic-root filtering and grouping

The v2-only `isRootObservation` boolean dimension identifies application entry points. `true` includes both outer roots with no parent and app roots whose OpenTelemetry instrumentation or infrastructure parent was filtered from export by the SDK. Use it to count, filter, or group application entry points without missing the latter case. See [Logical root observations](/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/observations-api#logical-root-observations) for the distinction between physical and logical roots and trace-counting edge cases.

For example, add this condition to a query's `filters` array to count semantic roots:

```json
[
  {
    "column": "isRootObservation",
    "operator": "=",
    "value": true,
    "type": "boolean"
  }
]
```

### Ordering by metrics

When ordering by an aggregated metric, use the returned metric field name in the format `{aggregation}_{measure}`, for example `sum_totalCost` for `{ "measure": "totalCost", "aggregation": "sum" }`. When ordering by the time dimension, use the returned field name `time_dimension`.

### Example: Most expensive models used in observations

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <BASIC AUTH HEADER>" \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode 'query={
    "view": "observations",
    "metrics": [{"measure": "totalCost", "aggregation": "sum"}],
    "dimensions": [{"field": "providedModelName"}],
    "filters": [],
    "fromTimestamp": "2025-12-01T00:00:00Z",
    "toTimestamp": "2025-12-16T00:00:00Z",
    "orderBy": [{"field": "sum_totalCost", "direction": "desc"}],
    "config": {"row_limit": 1000}
  }' \

## Agent Instructions

This page is part of the [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) documentation, published as plain Markdown for AI agents. Every page is available as Markdown by appending `.md` to its URL, or by sending an `Accept: text/markdown` header. This page: `https://langfuse.com/docs/metrics/features/metrics-api.md`.

### Querying these docs

If the answer is not on this page, query the documentation instead of guessing:

- **Semantic search** across all Langfuse docs, returning an answer with the relevant pages and excerpts. Ask a specific, self-contained question:

  ```bash
  curl -sG "https://langfuse.com/api/search-docs" --data-urlencode "query=How do I trace a LangGraph agent?"
  ```

- **Index of every page**: <https://langfuse.com/llms.txt>, with per-section indexes [llms-docs.txt](https://langfuse.com/llms-docs.txt), [llms-integrations.txt](https://langfuse.com/llms-integrations.txt), and [llms-self-hosting.txt](https://langfuse.com/llms-self-hosting.txt).

### Before writing Langfuse code

- **Install the [Langfuse Agent Skill](https://langfuse.com/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/agent-skill).** It encodes Langfuse's own best practices for instrumentation, prompt management, and evaluation, and materially improves results.
- **Read [What does a good trace look like?](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/best-practices.md)** before instrumenting an application.
- **Verify endpoints, parameters, and response fields** against the [API reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com) instead of inferring them from code examples.
- **Use the [Langfuse CLI](https://langfuse.com/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/cli)** (`npx langfuse-cli api <resource> <action>`) to read or write traces, prompts, datasets, and scores from the terminal.

# Complaint Eval

## Prompt

You are grading a single customer-support response against a fixed rubric.

CUSTOMER MESSAGE:
{customer_message}

SITUATIONAL CONTEXT (grader-only — the model under test did not see this):
{context}

RESPONSE UNDER TEST:
{response}

APPLICABLE BINARY CRITERIA: {binary_criteria}
CASE-SPECIFIC AUTO-FAIL: {auto_fail}
TONE TARGET: {min_tone_score}

CRITERION DEFINITIONS:
{paste section 1 table}

TONE ANCHORS:
{paste section 2 table}

GLOBAL AUTO-FAILS:
{paste section 3 list}

Instructions:
- Grade ONLY the applicable binary criteria. Ignore the others.
- For each, output 1 or 0 plus a quoted span from the response as evidence.
  If you cannot quote evidence, the score is 0.
- Check auto-fails before anything else. If one triggers, quote it and stop.
- Score tone once, holistically, against the anchors.
- Do not reward length, formatting, or politeness markers on their own.
- Do not penalize a response for being short if it satisfies the criteria.

Output strict JSON:
{
  "auto_fail": {"triggered": bool, "which": str|null, "evidence": str|null},
  "binary": {"<CRITERION_ID>": {"score": 0|1, "evidence": str, "reason": str}},
  "tone": {"score": 1-5, "reason": str},
  "notes": str
}

##  Scores
- Score Type: Categorical
- Categories: auto_fail, binary, tone, notes
